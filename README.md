# reading-text-file
The solution to reading-text-file task on Zuri-training,
I'm about to start my rant,
  so during the course of this project/task, i had learnt a lot of things like:
  + knowing tht programming is not for the weak
  + learning functions in python,
  + there are diffent ways to solve a coding problem,
  + googling is a crucial skill for every programmer,
  + knowing how to research is very very important,
  + i hope this solution is correct.
so, i think this is all i can write from the top of my head.
